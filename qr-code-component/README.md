## Overview

The goal of this challenge was to build a QR code component that looks as close as possible to the given Figma design. The project focuses on practicing layout fundamentals (centering, padding, gaps), styling consistency (colors, shadows, border-radius), and handling assets correctly in a React/Vite environment. Although simple, it’s a great exercise for paying attention to detail.

## My process

I started by breaking down the Figma design into a simple skeleton structure using semantic HTML elements (`img`, `h1`, `p`). Then I wrapped everything in a `card` container and focused on centering it on the page using flexbox on the `<body>`. Once the skeleton was in place, I added CSS step by step: background color, card box with padding and shadow, styling the QR image with rounded corners, and finally typography for the heading and description. I continuously compared the result against the design to refine spacing, alignment, and color accuracy. I also cleaned up unused Vite template code to keep the project lightweight and focused.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS (custom properties, flexbox, shadows, responsive units)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) – JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) – Build tool
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me practice translating **Figma specs into CSS**. For example, the design used auto-layout with padding `16px 16px 40px 16px` and a gap of `24px`, which directly translated into:

```css
.card {
	display: flex;
	flex-direction: column;
	padding: 16px 16px 40px 16px;
	gap: 24px;
	border-radius: 20px;
}
```
